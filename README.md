# Patientor frontend

### Getting started
  - To get the app running just install its dependencies with ```npm install``` and run it with ```npm run dev```.
  - The app should work without a backend, but make sure that the request made to ```/api/ping``` made on startup is successful before continuing.

## Backend Integration

Patientor Frontend can be integrated with a backend server to manage patient records. You can use your own implementation of the backend by connecting to the repository [patientor](https://github.com/cajsanu/patientor). Make sure the backend server is running and accessible to the frontend application.

## Features

- **Add New Patients:** Add new patients to the system with relevant information.
